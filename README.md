# Excel-Macros
Today I learned about the excel Macros and tried to implement it
we can add data and just press the update button to automatically update the list .

this helps us to arrange as required without much working hard with just a click.

Here's how my data initially looked and I wanted to insert this new data into the table.

by just clicking on the button it all got arranged automatically into the table as per requirement
